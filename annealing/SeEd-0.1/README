INSTRUCTIONS
------------

  This perl script can be used to design sequences with altered codon pair
bias, while conforming to a specific codon distribution. It provides flexibility
to define the coding regions, lock sequence locations from any alteration and
eliminate given restriction sites. It uses simulated annealing to optimize the
codon pair score and accepts a parameter for the number of iterations of the
algorithm.

  All necessary files to run the program are contained in the SeEd.tar.gz file.
After extraction, 'data' and 'output' directories will be created automatically.
All the parameters this program accepts will be presented when the script is
run with no parameters or the wrong number of mandatory arguments.

  Sample files are provided in the data directory. These include the wildtype
polio virus, a coding regions file that specifies the P1 region, a file
containing enzymes to be eliminated and a file that specifies regions to
be locked. An example command to run on these sample files is given in the
'sample_command' text file. All files provided are in ASCII text and can be 
viewed with any text editor.

  Statistics files will be generated in the 'output' directory, which should
always exist, where the output sequences are generated in the STDOUT of the
program, unless otherwise specified with a parameter. Both minimized and
maximized codon pair sequences are generated at the same time.

  The codon pair score indicates the aggregation over all codon pairs. In order
to derive the normalized score, one has to divide by the total number of 
codons in the coding regions used.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

  The program has been succesfully run in a variety of linux platforms.
It assumes the availability of a perl interpreter and has been run and tested
with perl interpreters available after 2003.
